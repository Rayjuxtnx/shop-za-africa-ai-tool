        Analyze the user's request: "${question}"
        Based on the user's request, decide if one of the available tools can help you answer.
        - If the user asks a factual question (e.g., "What is X?", "Who is Y?") that is NOT "Who is Philip?", use the 'answerFactBasedQuestion' tool.
        - If the user provides a block of text and asks to summarize it, use the 'summarizeText' tool.
        - If the user asks to write a story or poem, use the 'creativeWriting' tool.
        
        If no tool is suitable, provide a helpful, conversational response directly.
        Do not ask clarifying questions about which tool to use. Make the decision yourself.
        When you use a tool, you will be provided with the output of that tool. Your final response to the user should be based on that output.`,
